=Results overview

For each sample the pipeline creates a folder with sample ID name to write results, and produce a number of files. 

Result files for this workshop can be found in the folder with name `ENCSR000COQ/`. There you should see following files:

Variant calls::

* final.vcf
This file contains somatic variants (SNVs) called from RNAseq data. 

* diff.sites_in_files 	
comparison of the SNVs from RNAseq data with the set of known variants

* known_snps.vcf 	
SNVs that are common between RNAseq calls and known variants

Allele specific expression quantification::
* ASE.tsv 	
allele counts at a positions of SNVs (only for common SNVs)

Allele frequency histogram::

* AF.histogram.pdf 	
a histogram plot for allele frequency (only for common SNVs)
