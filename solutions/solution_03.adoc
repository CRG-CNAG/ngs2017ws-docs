/*
 * Process 1B: Create a FASTA genome sequence dictionary with Picard for GATK
 */

process '1B_prepare_genome_picard' {

  input:
      file genome from genome_file <1>
  output:
      file "${genome.baseName}.dict" into genome_dict_ch <2>

  script:
  """
  PICARD=`which picard.jar`
  java -jar \$PICARD CreateSequenceDictionary R= $genome O= ${genome.baseName}.dict
  """
}

<1> Take as input the `genome` file from `genome_file`  
<2> Give as output the file `${genome.baseName}.dict` and adds it to the channel `genome_dict_ch`
