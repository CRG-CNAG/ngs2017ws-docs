 * Process 1A: Create a FASTA genome index with samtools

process '1A_prepare_genome_samtools' { <1>

  input:
      file genome from genome_file <2>

  output:
      file "${genome}.fai" into genome_index_ch <3>

  script:

  samtools faidx ${genome} <4>

}

<1> The process is named `1A_prepare_genome_samtools`.

<2> The solution creates a variable `genome` from the
`genome_file` channel we created in the previous step.

<3> The output is file called `${genome}.fai` which becomes an element of a new channel called `genome_index_ch`.

<4> The script section calls for the execution of the `samtools` program with the
argument `faidx` for fasta index and the `${genome}` as the input.
