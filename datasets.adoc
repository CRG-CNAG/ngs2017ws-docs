==Input data

.*Genome assembly*, *.fa

Human genome assembly v.hg19, chr 22 only.

.*RNAs-Seq data*, *.fastq 
The RNA-Seq data comes from the human GM12878 cell line from the whole cell, cytosol and nucleous extraction (table 1).  The libraries are stranded PE76 Illumina GAIIx RNA-Seq from rRNA-depleted Poly-A+ long RNA  (> 200 nucleotides in size). 
Here we're  using a subset of these reads, those mapped to the locus 22q11 of the human genome, chr22:16000000-18000000

.*"Known" variants*, *.vcf
Known variants comes from high confident variant calls for GM12878 from the Illumina Platinum Genomes project  from the chromosome 22.

.*Blacklisted regions*, *.bed
Blacklisted regions, or the regions with anomalous coverage, are taken from the ENCODE project, chromosome 22 from the assembly release hg19.
